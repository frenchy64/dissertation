% - set the scene for inferring types
%   - Typed Clojure
%   - optional/gradual typing requires annotations

This paper starts to address a major usability flaw
for gradually and optionally typed languages:
writing type annotations is a manual process.

Take \texttt{vertices} (Figure~\ref{vertices}),
written in Clojure.
As is good style, it comes with a unit test.
Our goal is to \textit{generate} Typed Clojure~\cite{bonnaire2016practical}
annotations
for this function, relieving most of the annotation
burden.

\begin{figure}
\begin{cljlisting}
(defn vertices [t]
  (case (:op t)
    :leaf 1
    :node (+ 1 (vertices (:left t))
               (vertices (:right t)))))
(deftest vertices-test
  (is (= 3 (vertices {:op :node 
                      :left {:op :leaf :val 2}
                      :right {:op :leaf :val 3}}))))
\end{cljlisting}
\caption{A function counting vertices in a tree, with a test.}
\label{vertices}
\end{figure}

Our approach features several stages.
First, we \textit{instrument} top-level functions
(Section \ref{instrument-TODO}),
then run the unit tests and \textit{track}
how they are used at runtime
(Section \ref{track-TODO}).
At this point, we have a preliminary
annotation:

\begin{cljlisting}
(ann vertices ['{:op ':node,
                 :left '{:op ':leaf,
                         :val Int},
                 :right '{:op ':leaf,
                          :val Int}}
               -> Int]})
\end{cljlisting}

This type is too specific---trees are recursively
defined---we \textit{squash} types to be
recursive from example unrollings (Section \ref{recursive-TODO}):

\begin{cljlisting}
(defalias NodeLeaf 
  (U '{:op ':node, :left NodeLeaf, :right NodeLeaf}
     '{:op ':leaf, :val Int}))
(ann vertices [NodeLeaf -> Int])
\end{cljlisting}

%\begin{Verbatim}
%(declare Node Leaf)
%(defalias NodeLeaf (U Node Leaf))
%(defalias Node 
%  '{:op ':node :left NodeLeaf :right NodeLeaf})
%(defalias Leaf '{:op ':leaf :val int})
%(ann verbatim [NodeLeaf -> Int]})
%\end{Verbatim}
%
If \texttt{NodeLeaf} is used in multiple positions
in the program, local recursive types are redundant.
In this paper, we name and \textit{merge} recursive
types, reusing them in annotations.
 
\begin{cljlisting}
(ann vertices [NodeLeaf -> Int])
(ann sum-tree [NodeLeaf NodeLeaf -> NodeLeaf])
\end{cljlisting}
 
If minor variants of the recursive types occur
across a program,
we use \textit{optional} entries%~\cite{typed-clojure}
to reduce redundancy (Section \ref{optional-merge-TODO}).
 
\begin{cljlisting}
(defalias NodeLeaf 
  (U '{:op ':node, :left NodeLeaf, :right NodeLeaf}
     (HMap :mandatory {:op ':leaf :val Int}
           :optional {:label Str})))
\end{cljlisting}

After inserting these annotations, we can run the
type checker over them to check their usefulness.
We found annotations to be readable and minimize
redundancy compared to hand-written annotations
(Section \ref{experiment1}).
Minimal changes were needed to successfully type check
functions with the generated annotations,
mostly consisting of local function and loop annotations,
and renaming of type aliases
(Section \ref{experiment2}).
Generating and running \textit{tests} improved the quality
of type annotations by exercising more paths through the
program (Section \ref{experiment3}).

Several open questions remain.
Automatically
drawing the typed-untyped boundary in gradual typing
would mean less manual casts are needed.
(Section \ref{boundaries}).

%The Clojure programming language has several verification
%systems that require annotating your programs.
%Typed Clojure is a type system that supports many Clojure
%idioms. Here, we must provide type annotations for
%top level variables, local functions, and invoked libraries.
%Clojure.spec is a pseudo contract system
%that can also generate tests.
%Similarly, specifications (``specs'') must be provided
%for all top level variables.
%
%These annotations are useful for learning about our programs,
%but they can be burdensome to write and maintain.
%Currently, one must reverse engineer annotations
%by visual analysis of the source code.
%
%In this paper, we present a tool that automatically
%generates annotations, based on the tests already present
%in idiomatic Clojure programs.
%These annotations are readable, compact, feature good
%names, and recover recursively defined records.
%There is no guarantee the generated annotations will
%immediately type check, however.
%
%Our goal is to minimize the difference needed
%to type check programs from the generated annotations.
%We envision programmers running our tool, generating
%a few dozen lines of annotations, and only a fraction
%of them should need manual changing to actually type
%check a program.
