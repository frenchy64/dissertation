I first touched down in Bloomington ready to start my graduate career---that is, until 
my puzzled cab driver Juannita informed me with a gasp
we were in Bloomington, \emph{Illinois}.
She kindly agreed to drive me to IU, a 12-hour roundtrip---a humbling start to graduate school.
The next day, reconnecting with Dan Friedman and the inspirational Will Byrd came full circle.
Thanks Jason Hemann, Cam \& Rebecca Swords, Jaime Guerrero, 
and Tori Vollmer for helping me find my feet.

Since then, Andrew Kent and I have done most things together, like deciphering 
set-theoretic types, floating down a Eugene river,
weekly Zelda gaming, and dissertating.
Andrew and his delightful family took me under their wing---thanks
Carrie, Charlotte, Harrison, Sydney, and Dwight.

Thanks to my donators, talk attendees, and users, including
Chas Emerick, Brandon Bloom, David Nolen,
Ghadi Shayban, Nicola Mometto, Devin Walters, Reid McKenzie, Nathan Sorenson, Eric
Normand, Craig Andera, Jim Duey, Kyle Kingsbury, Colin Fleming, Paula Gearon,
Nikko Patten, and Claire Alvis who were very encouraging.
CircleCI enabled discussion of Typed Clojure ``in practice,'' and their post-mortem
summarized my frustrations with Typed Clojure.

Sam taught me how (and when) to turn my implementations into research.
He has been supportive, trusting, and always game to clarify my bizarre ideas.
Mike Vollmer helped brainstorm the annotator;
I'm grateful for Mike's presense and support. I fondly remember our
conversations, nagivating Mumbai together, and bad-movie nights.
The annotator took shape at weekly meetings---thanks
Matteo Cimini, Rajan Walia, Spenser Bauman, Jeremy Siek, Mike Vitousek, Deyaaeldeen Almahallawi,
Caner Derici, Sarah Spall, and David Christiansen for your attention and suggestions.

Symbolic closures were the result of many conversations.
Andre Kuhlenschmidt's interest in them during my final PL Wonks talk
helped me through the last weeks before my defense.
Thanks to Wonks regulars  
Ryan Scott, Kyle Carter, 
Vikraman Choudhury, Matthew Heimerdinger, Paulette Koronkevich, Aaron Hsu, Praveen Narayanan,
and Chaitanya Koparkar for your engagement.

Thanks to my committee Ryan, Larry, and Ken for your feedback.
I found Ryan's compilers course and Larry's logic course invigorating,
and I'm grateful to Ken for always asking the right questions.

Thanks to my friends and family, especially Mum, Dad, and Aaron.
Having a partner with experience in Computer Science research has been wonderful, 
and my wife Marcela Poffald is my greatest advocate.
Her feedback has improved and clarified my work,
and her continuous requests
to be referred to as ``Mrs.~Typed Clojure'' with a matching cap never
fail to make me blush.
