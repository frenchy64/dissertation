\section{Thesis Statement}

My thesis statement is:

\begin{quote}
Typed Clojure is a sound and practical optional type system for Clojure and the process of porting to Typed Clojure can be partially-automated, and this automation technology can be repurposed to further reveal how Clojure is used in real projects.
%Typed Clojure is a sound and practical optional type system for Clojure, and we can relieve the annotation burden for such verification systems by automatically annotating programs based on their runtime behavior.
%Typed Clojure is a sound and practical optional type system for Clojure whose annotation burden is partially-automatable, and this automation technology can be repurposed to generate clojure.spec annotations and test its effectiveness in hundreds of projects.
% to study how Clojure is used in real projects.
%Typed Clojure is sound, practical, and its annotation burden is partially-automatable,
%and we can repurpose this annotation technology to
%answer broad questions about how Clojure is used.
%Typed Clojure is a well-founded and practical optional type system for Clojure
%whose useability can be improved by
%developing a tool to automatically generate type annotations,
%and, by repurposing this tool, we can study general Clojure idioms and practices across
%hundreds of projects by generating, running, and exercising clojure.spec runtime specifications.
\end{quote}

I will support this thesis statement with the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Typed Clojure is sound} We formalize Typed Clojure, including
    its characteristic features like hash-maps, multimethods, and Java interoperability,
    and proven the model type sound.
  \item \emph{Typed Clojure is practical} We present an empirical study of real-world Typed Clojure usage
    in over 19,000 lines of code, showing its features correspond to actual usage patterns.
  \item \emph{Typed Clojure's annotation burden is partially-automatable} We formalize and implement a tool to generate
    type annotations, and empirically study the manual changes needed for the generated annotations
    to pass type checking.
  %\item \emph{clojure.spec model and Automatic Annotations} 
  \item \emph{Repurpose automation technology}
  %\item \emph{Repurpose automation technology}
  %\item \emph{clojure.spec spec's annotation burden is partially-automatable}
    We describe how to automatically generate clojure.spec annotations (``specs'') for existing programs by reusing
    most of the the infrastructure for automatic Typed Clojure annotations.
    We present a formal model of clojure.spec (an existing and popular runtime verification tool for Clojure)
    and implement the model in Redex.
  \item \emph{Study how Clojure is used in real projects}
    We conduct a study of general Clojure idioms and practices by generating, enforcing, and exercising specs
    across hundreds of projects, as well as analyzing design choices in Typed Clojure's type system,
    clojure.spec's features, and our automatic annotation tool.
  %\item \emph{Test effectiveness of clojure.spec annotation generation}
  %  We test the effectiveness of our generated specs by generating, enforcing, and exercising specs
  %  across hundreds of projects, as well as analyze design choices in Typed Clojure's type system and
  %  clojure.spec's features.


    % our annotation approach can be repurposed to generate clojure.spec which can be \emph{run}.
    % use results to explore both the quality of the tool and to explore what the inferred specs
    % tell us about clj programs.
\end{itemize}
