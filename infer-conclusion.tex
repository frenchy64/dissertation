Our approach to automatically
generate recursive types from unrolled examples,
has proven
even with the challenge of 

We have tested our approach on thousands of lines
of Clojure code,
Typed Clojure types for Clojure
programs. Despite the fact that Clojure programs
declare minimal structure, we successfully
