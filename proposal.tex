\caption{Typed Clojure Features used in Practice}
\label{experience:featuretable}
\end{figure*}

Throughout this thesis, we will focus on three interrelated type
system features: heterogeneous maps, Java interoperability, and
multimethods. Our hypothesis is that these features are widely used in
existing Clojure programs in interconnecting ways, and that handling
them as we have done is required to type check realistic Clojure
programs.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we will present an analysis of two existing \coretyped{}
code bases, one from the open-source community, and one from a company
that uses \coretyped{} in production (\figref{experience:featuretable}).
%For our data gathering, we
%instrumented the \coretyped{} type checker to record how often
%various features were used (summarized in \figref{experience:featuretable}).

\subsection{Automatic Annotation Approach}

We now describe our philosophy and overall approach to automatic annotations for Typed Clojure.
At a high level, there are three phases to
generating annotations: instrumentation, runtime tracking, and type reconstruction.

The first phase, \textbf{instrumentation}, involves
rewriting the code we wish to annotate such
that we can record its runtime behavior.
In this phase, we usually require the programmer to
indicate which code we wish to generate types
for in advance, with a file-level granuality.

Once instrumented, we observe our running program
via \textbf{runtime tracking}. To exercise our programs,
we usually run their unit tests, generative tests,
or just normally run the program (eg. to generate types for
a game, we can simply play the game for a few minutes).
We accumulate the results of tracking via \textbf{paths}.
If we think of types as trees and supply a label
for each branching path, our inference results
specify the type down a particular path in this tree.

Finally, the information collected during runtime tracking
is combined into annotations by our \textbf{inference algorithm}.
We first combine all inference result into a large tree of
types. If we were to convert this tree into annotations directly,
our annotations would be too specific---they would be too
deep and fine-grained.
Instead, our algorithm iterates over several passes to massage
this tree, generating good names for the nodes, compacting similar
types across the tree, and
eventually converting the tree into a directed graph by reconstructing
recursive types.

%Let's demonstrate this pipeline, with our opening example.
%
%...
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%
%\end{verbatim}

An important question to answer is ``how accurate are these annotations?''.
Unlike some previous work in this area~\cite{An10dynamicinference}, we do not aim for soundness guarantees
in our generated types.
Our main contribution is a tool that Clojure programmers
can use to help learn about and specify their programs.
In that spirit, annotations should meet several criteria.

\paragraph{Good names}
Typed Clojure %and clojure.spec 
annotations are abundant
with useful names for types. A good name often increases
readability.
Good names can sometimes be reconstructed from the program source,
like function or parameter names, and other times 
we can use the shape of a type to summarize it.

\paragraph{Compact}
Idiomatic Clojure code rarely mixes certain types in the same position,
unless the program is polymorphic. Using this knowledge---which we observed
by the annotations and specs assigned to idiomatic Clojure 
code---we can rule out certain combinations of types to compact our
resulting output, without losing information that would help us
type check our programs.

\paragraph{Recursive}
Maps in Clojure are often heterogeneous, and recursively defined.
Typed Clojure %and clojure.spec 
supplies mechanisms for the most
common case: maps of known keyword entries.
We strategically \textbf{squash} flat types to be recursive
based on their unrolled shape.
For example, a recursively defined union of maps almost always
contains a known keyword ``tag'' mapped to a keyword.
By identifying this tag, we can reconstruct a good recursive
approximation of this type.

%\subsection{Naming}
%
%For a type to be immediately useful to a programmer, it helps
%to have a great name. We explored several avenues for
%generating good names.
%
%For types that occured as function arguments, the name of
%the argument often indicated its role in the program.
%Names like \textbf{config} or \textbf{env} are often used
%for an environment being functionally threaded through
%the program.
%
%Similarly, types that occur as values in configuration
%maps often have descriptive keys. In the Star Trek 
%game, the configuration map maps \textbf{:stardate}
%to a map that contains three number entries: 
%\textbf{:start},
%\textbf{:current}, and
%\textbf{:end}.
%
%What if a type occurs in the return position of a function?
%Sometimes these are named by \textbf{let} binding the result
%of the computation.
%
%Failing these heuristics, we fall back of several approaches
%to naming.
%First, if we are naming a keyword map which is part of a tagged
%union, we use the tag as the name. For example, if the tagged entry
%maps \textbf{:op} to \textbf{:fn}, we name this map \textbf{FnOp}.
%Failing that, for maps with less than three entries, we simply
%enumerate its entries as the name.
%Finally, for large keyword maps, we give an abbreviation
%of its keyset as a name.
%
%\begin{Verbatim}
%(defn f [x] (inc x))
%\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Automatic Annotations Formalism}

We provide a preliminary grammar for our formal treatment of automatic
annotations, and a semantics for the instrumentation phase
of our automatic annotator.
The full thesis will describe the type reconstruction algorithm in
detail.

\figref{infer:grammar} presents the grammar. Similar to Typed Clojure's
formalism, we use paths $\inferpath{}$ to represent a path through
a value. Path elements consist of the domain of a function $\dompe{}$,
the range of a function $\rngpe{}$, and the result of a map lookup 
of key ${\kw2{}}$ on a map with key set ${\overrightarrow{\kw1{}}}$
$\inferkeype{\overrightarrow{\kw1{}}}{\kw2{}}$.
Inference results $\res{}$ are collected during execution, and
associate a path $\inferpath{}$ with the type of value observed
at that path $\tau$.

\figref{infer:semantics} gives a semantics for the instrumentation
phase of the automatic annotation tool.
Most rules are standard, with B-Get and B-Assoc responsible for
looking up and associating new entries onto maps.
The B-Track rule is the entry point for tracking values,
calling $\trackmeta{}$ (\figref{infer:track}), that
rewrites a value $\val{}$ to $\val{}'$ and generates inference
results $\res{}'$ based on the input that $\inferpath{}$
is the path of $\val{}$.

Several extensions to this model are possible.
First, we will add \emph{space-efficient} runtime instrumentation,
This ensures that stack space usage is efficient by collapsing
directly stacked wrappers of the same kind. For example, wrapping
a function twice takes the same stack space as wrapping once.
The propagation of path information is then extended to support
\emph{multiple} simultaneous paths for each value, which enables
the optimization to not lose any tracking information.

Second, we can infer \emph{polymorphic} types by tracking
the pointer identity of objects. This information
can be combined with the base tracking information to generate
polymorphic type annotations that also feature concrete types
when appropriate.

\subsection{Typed Clojure Automatic Annotations Evaluation}

Along with a manual inspection of the generated Typed Clojure annotations,
we will perform several other experiments to measure the quality of the
generated annotations.

For example, we measure the number of changes needed
needed to amend generated annotations to actually type check.
\figref{infer:amending} shows some preliminary results.

\subsection{Two Areas of Further Study}

The following two subsections describe
several possible research areas for the final section of this
dissertation.

At least one of the following investigations will be included in the dissertation.
The selection process will be informed by the success of early prototypes
and preliminary investigations.

\subsubsection{Option 1: Type check more Clojure programs}

A complaint from industrial users about Typed Clojure is that support for
core Clojure functionality and idioms is limited.
Furthermore, even if
a set of functionality is supported, combining them in a helper function
often give undesired results.

CircleCI summarized their experience with Typed Clojure~\cite{CircleCIBlog}, citing
several specific frustrations. One representative issue we will discuss
is that Typed Clojure cannot reliably infer usages of polymorphic higher-order functions.
The root of this problem is known as the \emph{Hard to synthesize arguments} problem~\cite{hosoya1999good}, and
has two competing forces: local type argument synthesis for polymorphic applications and
the bidirectional propagation of anonymous function argument types.

For example, consider mapping a collection over the identity function \texttt{(map (fn [x] x) [1 2 3])}.
To infer \texttt{map}'s type variables, we first type check the arguments.
Unfortunately, \texttt{(fn [x] x)} has no annotation, and so its type is \texttt{[Any -> Any]}, making
the entire invocation type \texttt{(Seq Any)} (instead of the more desirable \texttt{(Seq Int)}).

Even \texttt{(map identity [1 2 3])} has its own set of problems: both
\texttt{map} and \texttt{identity} are polymorphic, and thus cannot be inferred accurately by 
many systems based on Pierce and Turner's Local Type Inference~\cite{PierceLTI} (like Typed Clojure and Typed Racket).
This specific problem is addressed by later work in the realm of set-theoretic types~\cite{polyduce2},
by generating substitutions for the arguments of applications. However, even
there, it cannot simultaneously infer the type of the function argument of
\texttt{(map (fn [x] x) [1 2 3])}.

Anonymous functions are common in Clojure. For example, the ClojureScript compiler
uses around 40 anonymous functions in around 140 top-level definitions.
Most of these functions would require extra annotations to type check, and
over half of them are used as arguments to polymorphic higher-order functions.

To address excessive annotations and broaden the number of checkable programs,
we will design and implement an approach to mitigate the issue of \emph{Hard
to synthesize arguments} in common Clojure code, and report its the effectiveness
in reducing the number of changes in the porting process from Clojure to
Typed Clojure.

Some initial investigation in this direction has centered around building
an extensible system for specifying type rules, and enhancing symbolic
execution capabilities. For example
%
\texttt{(update m :a (fn [a] (inc a)))}
%
increments the \texttt{:a}
entry of map \texttt{m}. A custom \texttt{update} rule
effectively inlines the call to \texttt{update} as \texttt{(assoc m :a ((fn [a] (inc a)) (get m :a)))},
which allows parameter \texttt{a} to inherit the type of \texttt{(get m :a)}.

A more complicated example uses Clojure transducers. The expression 
\texttt{(comp (map (fn [a] (dec a))) (map (fn [a] (inc a))))} is a transducer that first
decrements, then increments (transducers compose left-to-right).
Since \texttt{comp}, and \texttt{map} are polymorphic higher-order
functions, and we use anonymous functions, this is hard to type check.
However, by combining custom type rules for \texttt{comp}, and \texttt{map}
with symbolic computations and adequate type propagation, we could potentially distil the original expression to
\texttt{(inc (dec input))}, which is much easier to check.

\subsubsection{Option 2: clojure.spec Automatic Annotations}

Clojure.spec is popular runtime verification system for Clojure programs included
in the core Clojure distribution.
%We will present a formal model of clojure.spec and 
We will repurpose our automatic annotation
tool to generate clojure.spec runtime specifications.

We will then conduct a larger scale investigation to evaluate the quality 
of these annotations by generating clojure.spec annotations for several hundred
projects we have sourced from the open source community.
This investigation will also serve to further analyze the assumptions made 
in designing Typed Clojure and clojure.spec.
For example, Typed Clojure and clojure.spec are designed differently
around qualified entries in maps, and by generating and enforcing specs
we can investigate whether either are compatible with actual usage.

We can empirically investigate which function spec checking semantics are 
applicable in the majority of code. Since clojure.spec provides
two distinct function checking semantics, including a surprising
``generative testing'' semantics, we can measure the likelihood
of tests still passing after generating each kind of function spec.

Other interesting questions can be asked by using clojure.spec's generative
testing features. After generating our own specs automatically for each project,
we can test to see if our annotation algorithm feeds sufficient information
to clojure.spec's value generators to create effective generative tests.
We can also use the generative tests as a ``second pass'' over the functions,
by re-instrumenting our functions and analyzing whether we get better
test coverage than just running the provided unit tests.

clojure.spec supports stubbing-out functions, useful for running unit
tests that depend on side effecting functions. For example, we might
stub-out functions that call a database that only exists in production.
Using our generated specs, we could experimentally stub-out functions
that consistently fail their specs under generative testing,
and measure how useful the chosen stubs are by manually inspecting
which functions were stubbed.
Similarly, we could experiment in stubbing out function arguments
to higher-order functions to make instrumentation with \texttt{fspec}s
more predictable.

%\subsubsection{Option 3: How Clojure is used}

There is potential for other, more general, research questions
to be answered about Clojure usage with our testing setup.
Part of the unfinished work towards this thesis will be devising research questions,
but, for now, we can imagine a spectrum of questions
from simple measurements of the frequency of particular features like variable-arguments,
keyword maps, or higher-order functions, to more ambitious questions
like detecting breaking changes between project versions
and quantifying the test coverage of unit tests versus generative tests.

\section{Related Work}

% Cite a few of the early papers here.
%http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/pubs/
\paragraph{Typed Multimethods} 
Millstein and collaborators present a sequence of
systems~\cite{Chambers:1992:OMC,Chambers:1994:TMM,MS02} with statically-typed multimethods
and modular type checking.  In contrast to Typed Clojure, in these
system methods declare the types of arguments that they expect which
corresponds to exclusively using \clj{class} as the dispatch function
in Typed Clojure. However, Typed Clojure does not attempt to rule out
failed dispatches.

% one sentence
% TC based on TR, already covered

\paragraph{Occurrence Typing} 
Occurrence typing~\cite{TF08,TF10} extends the type 
system with a \emph{proposition environment} that represents 
the information on the types of bindings down conditional branches.
These propositions are then used to update the types associated
with bindings in the \emph{type environment} down branches
so binding occurrences are given different types 
depending on the branches they appear in, and the conditionals
that lead to that branch.

% What's diff about TC from the related work
% small summary for diesel....
% - diesel supports x
%  - calculus supports some subset of x
% we support y, which covers most of x but also foo

% eg. multiple dispatch
%     nominal vs structural

% eg. run abritrary metaprogramming over dispatch in CLOS
%  more expressive

% type systems for mm or rows
% rows vs HMap
% - no poly in HMap
% - based on subtyping
% - rows based on polymorphism

\paragraph{Record Types} Row polymorphism~\cite{Wand89typeinference,CM91,HP91}, used
in systems such as the OCaml object system, provides many of the
features of HMap types, but defined using universally-quantified row
variables. HMaps in Typed Clojure are instead designed to be used with
subtyping, but nonetheless provide similar expressiveness, including
the ability to require presence and absence of certain keys. 

Dependent JavaScript~\cite{Chugh:2012:DTJ} can track similar
invariants as HMaps with types for JS objects. They must deal with
mutable objects, they feature refinement types and strong updates to
the heap to track changes to objects.

TeJaS~\cite{TeJaS}, another type system for JavaScript,
also supports similar HMaps, with the ability to
record the presence and absence of entries, but lacks a compositional
flow-checking approach like occurrence typing.

Typed Lua~\cite{Maidl:2014:TLO} has \emph{table types} which track
entries in a mutable Lua table.  Typed Lua changes the dynamic
semantics of Lua to accommodate mutability: Typed Lua raises a runtime
error for lookups on missing keys---HMaps consider lookups on missing
keys normal.

\paragraph{Java Interoperability in Statically Typed Languages}
Scala~\cite{OCD+} has nullable references for compatibility with Java.
Programmers must manually check for
\java{null} as in Java to avoid null-pointer exceptions. 


\paragraph{Other optional and gradual type systems}
%In addition to Typed Racket, 
Several other gradual type
systems have been developed for existing
dynamically-typed languages.  Reticulated Python~\cite{Vitousek14} is
an experimental gradually typed system for Python, implemented as a
source-to-source translation that inserts dynamic checks at language
boundaries and supporting Python's first-class object system. 
Clojure's nominal classes avoids the need to support
first-class object system in Typed Clojure, however HMaps offer an alternative to
the structural objects offered by Reticulated. Similarly,
Gradualtalk~\cite{gradualtalk} offers gradual typing for Smalltalk,
with nominal classes.

Optional types
%, requiring less implementation effort and avoiding
%runtime cost, 
have been  adopted in industry, including Hack~\cite{hack}, and Flow~\cite{flow} and
TypeScript~\cite{typescript}, two extensions of JavaScript. These
systems  support  limited forms of occurrence typing,
and do not include the other features we
present.

\paragraph{Automatic annotations}
There are two common implementation strategies for such tools. The first
strategy, ``ruling-out'' (for invariant detection), assumes all invariants are true 
and then use runtime analysis results to rule out
impossible invariants. The second ``building-up'' strategy (for dynamic type inference)
assumes nothing and then uses runtime analysis results to build up invariant/type knowledge.

Examples of invariant detection tools include Daikon \cite{Ernst06thedaikon},
DIDUCE \cite{hangal2002tracking}, and Carrot \cite{pytlik2003automated}, and
typically enhance statically typed languages with more expressive types or contracts.
Examples of dynamic type inference include Rubydust \cite{An10dynamicinference},
JSTrace \cite{saftoiu2010jstrace}, and TypeDevil \cite{pradel2015typedevil},
and typically target untyped languages.

Both strategies have different space behavior with respect to representing
the set of known invariants.
The ruling-out strategy typically uses a lot of memory at the beginning,
but then can free memory as it rules out invariants. For example, if
\texttt{odd(x)} and \texttt{even(x)} are assumed, observing \texttt{x = 1}
means we can delete and free the memory recording \texttt{even(x)}.
Alternatively, the building-up strategy uses the least memory storing
known invariants/types at the beginning, but increases memory usage
as more the more samples are collected. For example, if we know
\texttt{x : Bottom}, and we observe \texttt{x = "a"} and \texttt{x = 1}
at different points in the program, we must use more memory to
store the union \texttt{x : String $\cup$ Integer} in our set of known invariants.

\paragraph{Daikon}
Daikon can reason about very expressive relationships between variables
using properties like ordering ($x < y$), linear relationships ($y = ax + b$),
and containment ($x \in y$). It also supports reasoning with ``derived variables''
like fields ($x.f$), and array accesses ($a[i]$).

Typed Clojure's dynamic inference can record heterogeneous data structures
like vectors and hash-maps, but otherwise cannot express relationships
between variables.

There are several reasons for this. The most prominent is that Daikon
primarily targets Java-like languages, so inferring simple type information
would be redundant with the explicit typing disciplines of these languages.
On the other hand, the process of moving from Clojure to Typed Clojure
mostly involves writing simple type signatures without dependencies
between variables. Typed Clojure recovers relevant dependent information
via occurrence typing, and gives the option to manually annotate necessary
dependencies in function signatures when needed.


% Inference and Evolution of TypeScript Declaration Files
% - they submit pull requests from their tool's output
% https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/papers/tstools/paper.pdf
\paragraph{TypeScript Annotation Generation}
Kristensen and M{\o}ller~\cite{kristensen2017inference}
present TSInfer and TSEvolve that generate TypeScript annotation
files using static analysis of JavaScript code. They
submitted corrections back to libraries they found descrepancies in,
which were accepted with little to no changes in the tool's output.

NoRegrets~\cite{noregrets2018} uses dynamic analysis to learn how a program
is used, and automatically runs the tests of downstream projects to
improve test coverage. Its concept of representing a program sample as
a path paired with a type is very similar to Typed Clojure's approach.

\paragraph{How dynamic languages are used}
Several languages have seen similar investigations
into their idioms as I am proposing for Clojure.

A popular motivation is to discover which type system features to support
when retrofitting a type system.
% FIXME the is \AAkerblom but there's an error.. also in the bibliography
Akerblom et. al~\cite{Akerblom:2014:TDF:2597073.2597103} trace dynamic features in Python programs
via instrumentation. They measured the prevalence of dynamic features in startup versus
user code, and recorded usage frequencies for a set of dynamic features.
They concluded dynamism is prevalent in Python, and thus should be supported
in a retrofitted type system for Python.
A study along similar lines is also applicable to Clojure, in particular analysing Typed
Clojure's support for Clojure's dynamic features.

Calla{\'u} et al. \cite{Callau2013} also conducted a large-scale study of
dynamic Smalltalk idioms to inform future language extensions tooling support.
Notably, they further perform a qualitative analysis aiming to identify
the reasons why Smalltalk use these features in the first place, and
whether they can be replaced with more predictable features. They also 
measure which kinds of projects (e.g., testing frameworks, user-level libraries, or core system libraries) 
use particular features more frequently.
Due to the their prevalence in the open-source Clojure ecosystem,
Typed Clojure has mainly been tested on user-level libraries.
We could predict Typed Clojure's applicability to other kinds of projects
by gathering similar data on how frequently different types of Clojure libraries use
Clojure's various features.

Andreasen et. al~\cite{Andreasen2016TraceTA} developed
\emph{trace typing} to explore the design space of JavaScript type systems. 
Using runtime observations, they studied which control flow techniques
are used most often in JavaScript programs, and thus, which should
be supported by an effective type system for JavaScript.
Typed Clojure implements occurrence typing to reason about control
flow in Clojure which seems to work well in practice, but a similar
quantitative analysis could reveal further insights.

\paragraph{Interleaving Type Checking with Expansion, Extensible type systems and Symbolic Analysis}

Turnstile~\cite{Chang2017TSM} type checks a program during expansion
by repurposing the Racket macro system. It provides a fully extensible framework
for specifying and combining core typing rules.
On the other hand, Typed Clojure does not have the goal of allowing users to override
how language primitives type check. Instead, our goal is to provide
a simple interface to write type rules for library functions and macros
in a style that hides the necessary bookkeeping surrounding occurrence
typing and scope management.

SugarJ~\cite{Erdweg2011SJ}
adds syntactic language extensibility to languages like Java, such as pair
syntax, embedded XML, and closures.
Desugarings are expressed as rewrite rules to plain Java.
Similarly, work on \emph{type-specific languages}~\cite{omar2014safely}
adds extensible systems for the definitions of specialized syntax literals
to existing languages.
The \emph{type} of an expression determines how it is parsed and elaborated.

% this paper has a great related works section that differentiates
% the strategies of several typed metaprogramming techniques
SoundX~\cite{Lorenzen2016STS} presents a solution to a common
dilemma in typed metaprogramming: whether to desugar before
type checking, or vice-versa.
The authors present a system where a form is type checked before 
being desugared, with a guarantee that only well-typed code is generated.
Programmers specify desugarings with a combination of typing and rewriting rules, 
which are then connected to form a valid type derivation
in a process called \emph{forwarding}.
We will explore whether we can get the same effect in Typed Clojure
without requiring the user to understand typing rules.
%For example, Scala macros~\cite{Burmako2013SML} interleave type checking and
%desugaring

Ziggurat~\cite{Fisher06staticanalysis} allows programmers to define
the static and dynamic semantics of macros separately. To demonstrate its
broad applicability, they choose Scheme-like macros that generate assembly code
for the dynamic semantics.
They advocate building towers of static analyses, so
macros can be statically checked in terms the static semantics of other macros, instead
of just their assembly code expansions which would otherwise be too difficult to check.
This idea resembles our prototypes in defining custom typing rules for functions and macros in Typed Clojure,
where the dynamic semantics are defined by runtime Clojure constructs (\texttt{defn}
and \texttt{defmacro}), and towers of static semantics are progressively specified in terms of the static
analysis of other Clojure forms.

Mix~\cite{Khoo2010MTC} cleanly separates symbolic execution~\cite{King1976SEP} from type checking
in the same system, specifying a mode for (nested) regions of code.
They argue this tradeoff keeps the predictability of type checking, while preserving enough
symbolic execution to drive further checking.
In Typed Clojure, symbolic execution is managed by occurrence typing~\cite{TF10}.
Our preliminary explorations in symbolic execution for Typed Clojure, for example, type checks an
anonymous function if annotated, otherwise treats it symbolically.
As the authors envision, this is akin to automatically inserting
the mode of a code region based on its context, with a Mix-like language
becoming the intermediate language.

Type Tailoring~\cite{greenmanttailoring} is an approach to provide more information
to a host type system than it might be capable of by itself.
In particular, the authors use the host platform's metaprogramming functionality
to refine the types of calls based on the program syntax alone, as well as improve
error messages by incorporating surface syntax. Their experiments are based in Typed Racket, that fully expands
syntax before checking it. Since Typed Clojure recently changed to interleave macroexpansion
and type checking, we could extend this technique to also refine calls based on the
types of their arguments (like SoundX).


Other work is relevant to our investigations of improving the user experience
of Typed Clojure. SweetT~\cite{pombrio2018inferring} automatically infers type rules
for syntactic sugar. Helium~\cite{Heeren2003STI} provides hooks into the type inference
process for domain-specific type error messages.

\section{Research Plan and Timeline}

I have already made progress towards my thesis:

\begin{itemize}
  \item I have formalized Typed Clojure, including
    its characteristic features like hash-maps, multimethods, and Java interoperability,
    and prove the model type sound.
  \item I have conducted an empirical study of real-world Typed Clojure usage
    in over 19,000 lines of code, showing its features correspond to actual usage patterns.
  \item I have implemented and publicly released a tool that generates
    Typed Clojure and clojure.spec annotations, and started on a formalism.
  \item I have started an empirical study the of manual changes needed for the generated annotations
    to pass type checking is in progress.
  \item I have successfully run my clojure.spec annotation tool on several hundred open-source projects that
    will be used to drive further studies.
  \item I have prototyped an extensible typing rule system and symbolic execution for Typed Clojure.
\end{itemize}

To complete my thesis, I plan to follow this timeline:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[June-July 2018 - Completed]} Fix spec generation.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item devise and implement a one or more strategies to handle clojure.spec's
        heterogeneous map spec (and intelligently register global spec aliases)
      \item test out specs generation on candidate projects and improve the tool to fix obvious
        defects
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[July-August 2018 - Completed]} Proof-of-concept extensible typing rule system
    \begin{itemize}
      \item convert core.typed to control macroexpansion, rather than type-checking
        fully-expanded code.
      \item prototype interface for defining custom type rules for usages of top-level functions and macros.
      %\item complete proof-of-concept symbolic rewriting rules to aggressively move functions into
      %  invocation target position, like lifting conditionals and beta reduction, with
      %  na\"\i ve infinite loop detection.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[August 2018]} Finish formal model of automatic annotation tool.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item update formal model for annotation tool to include latest
        optimizations and fixes in recursive type reconstruction.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[September-October 2018]} Devise and carry out automatic annotation experiments
    \begin{itemize}
      %\item formulate and complete larger scale study on generation of specs for hundreds of projects.
      \item complete study that quantifies the changes needed to go from automatically annotated types
        to checked code.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[October-November 2018]} Write and submit automatic annotation paper (PLDI submission)
  \item \textbf{[November-December 2019]} Improve extensible typing rule system
    \begin{itemize}
      %\item provide tools to avoid double macroexpansion.
      \item support more core Clojure idioms using typing rules.
      \item revisit study quantifying manual type annotations using enhanced local inference
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[January-May 2019]} Write dissertation
  \item \textbf{[June 2019]} Defend
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Publications}

I plan to publish the following papers:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{ESOP 2016 - Published} \emph{Practical Optional Types for Clojure}~\cite{bonnaire2016practical}.
    A paper that provides a formal model of Typed Clojure and presents an empirical
    study of usage patterns.
  \item \textbf{Fall 2018} \emph{Squash the work: Automatic annotations for Typed Clojure and clojure.spec}
    A paper that presents a tool capable of generating Typed Clojure and clojure.spec
    annotations based on runtime observations of the program.
    We present a formal model of the tool, as well as several manual experiments in how
    accurate our annotations are.
    We conduct a larger study by sourcing several hundred projects and automatically
    generating types and specs, then using these annotations to answer various questions
    about how clojure.spec and Clojure is used.
\end{itemize}
