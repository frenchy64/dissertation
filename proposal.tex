\caption{Typed Clojure Features used in Practice}
\label{experience:featuretable}
\end{figure*}

Throughout this thesis, we will focus on three interrelated type
system features: heterogeneous maps, Java interoperability, and
multimethods. Our hypothesis is that these features are widely used in
existing Clojure programs in interconnecting ways, and that handling
them as we have done is required to type check realistic Clojure
programs.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we will present an analysis of two existing \coretyped{}
code bases, one from the open-source community, and one from a company
that uses \coretyped{} in production (\figref{experience:featuretable}).
%For our data gathering, we
%instrumented the \coretyped{} type checker to record how often
%various features were used (summarized in \figref{experience:featuretable}).

\subsection{Automatic Annotation Approach}

We now describe our philosophy and overall approach to automatic annotations for Typed Clojure.
At a high level, there are three phases to
generating annotations: instrumentation, runtime tracking, and type reconstruction.

The first phase, \textbf{instrumentation}, involves
rewriting the code we wish to annotate such
that we can record its runtime behavior.
In this phase, we usually require the programmer to
indicate which code we wish to generate types
for in advance, with a file-level granuality.

Once instrumented, we observe our running program
via \textbf{runtime tracking}. To exercise our programs,
we usually run their unit tests, generative tests,
or just normally run the program (eg. to generate types for
a game, we can simply play the game for a few minutes).
We accumulate the results of tracking via \textbf{paths}.
If we think of types as trees and supply a label
for each branching path, our inference results
specify the type down a particular path in this tree.

Finally, the information collected during runtime tracking
is combined into annotations by our \textbf{inference algorithm}.
We first combine all inference result into a large tree of
types. If we were to convert this tree into annotations directly,
our annotations would be too specific---they would be too
deep and fine-grained.
Instead, our algorithm iterates over several passes to massage
this tree, generating good names for the nodes, compacting similar
types across the tree, and
eventually converting the tree into a directed graph by reconstructing
recursive types.

%Let's demonstrate this pipeline, with our opening example.
%
%...
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%
%\end{verbatim}

An important question to answer is ``how accurate are these annotations?''.
Unlike some previous work in this area~\cite{An10dynamicinference}, we do not aim for soundness guarantees
in our generated types.
Our main contribution is a tool that Clojure programmers
can use to help learn about and specify their programs.
In that spirit, annotations should meet several criteria.

\paragraph{Good names}
Typed Clojure %and clojure.spec 
annotations are abundant
with useful names for types. A good name often increases
readability.
Good names can sometimes be reconstructed from the program source,
like function or parameter names, and other times 
we can use the shape of a type to summarize it.

\paragraph{Compact}
Idiomatic Clojure code rarely mixes certain types in the same position,
unless the program is polymorphic. Using this knowledge---which we observed
by the annotations and specs assigned to idiomatic Clojure 
code---we can rule out certain combinations of types to compact our
resulting output, without losing information that would help us
type check our programs.

\paragraph{Recursive}
Maps in Clojure are often heterogeneous, and recursively defined.
Typed Clojure %and clojure.spec 
supplies mechanisms for the most
common case: maps of known keyword entries.
We strategically \textbf{squash} flat types to be recursive
based on their unrolled shape.
For example, a recursively defined union of maps almost always
contains a known keyword ``tag'' mapped to a keyword.
By identifying this tag, we can reconstruct a good recursive
approximation of this type.

%\subsection{Naming}
%
%For a type to be immediately useful to a programmer, it helps
%to have a great name. We explored several avenues for
%generating good names.
%
%For types that occured as function arguments, the name of
%the argument often indicated its role in the program.
%Names like \textbf{config} or \textbf{env} are often used
%for an environment being functionally threaded through
%the program.
%
%Similarly, types that occur as values in configuration
%maps often have descriptive keys. In the Star Trek 
%game, the configuration map maps \textbf{:stardate}
%to a map that contains three number entries: 
%\textbf{:start},
%\textbf{:current}, and
%\textbf{:end}.
%
%What if a type occurs in the return position of a function?
%Sometimes these are named by \textbf{let} binding the result
%of the computation.
%
%Failing these heuristics, we fall back of several approaches
%to naming.
%First, if we are naming a keyword map which is part of a tagged
%union, we use the tag as the name. For example, if the tagged entry
%maps \textbf{:op} to \textbf{:fn}, we name this map \textbf{FnOp}.
%Failing that, for maps with less than three entries, we simply
%enumerate its entries as the name.
%Finally, for large keyword maps, we give an abbreviation
%of its keyset as a name.
%
%\begin{Verbatim}
%(defn f [x] (inc x))
%\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Automatic Annotations Formalism}

We provide a preliminary grammar for our formal treatment of automatic
annotations, and a semantics for the instrumentation phase
of our automatic annotator.
The full thesis will describe the type reconstruction algorithm in
detail.

\figref{infer:grammar} presents the grammar. Similar to Typed Clojure's
formalism, we use paths $\inferpath{}$ to represent a path through
a value. Path elements consist of the domain of a function $\dompe{}$,
the range of a function $\rngpe{}$, and the result of a map lookup 
of key ${\kw2{}}$ on a map with key set ${\overrightarrow{\kw1{}}}$
$\inferkeype{\overrightarrow{\kw1{}}}{\kw2{}}$.
Inference results $\res{}$ are collected during execution, and
associate a path $\inferpath{}$ with the type of value observed
at that path $\tau$.

\figref{infer:semantics} gives a semantics for the instrumentation
phase of the automatic annotation tool.
Most rules are standard, with B-Get and B-Assoc responsible for
looking up and associating new entries onto maps.
The B-Track rule is the entry point for tracking values,
calling $\trackmeta{}$ (\figref{infer:track}), that
rewrites a value $\val{}$ to $\val{}'$ and generates inference
results $\res{}'$ based on the input that $\inferpath{}$
is the path of $\val{}$.

Several extensions to this model are possible.
First, we will add \emph{space-efficient} runtime instrumentation,
This ensures that stack space usage is efficient by collapsing
directly stacked wrappers of the same kind. For example, wrapping
a function twice takes the same stack space as wrapping once.
The propagation of path information is then extended to support
\emph{multiple} simultaneous paths for each value, which enables
the optimization to not lose any tracking information.

Second, we can infer \emph{polymorphic} types by tracking
the pointer identity of objects. This information
can be combined with the base tracking information to generate
polymorphic type annotations that also feature concrete types
when appropriate.

\subsection{Typed Clojure Automatic Annotations Evaluation}

Along with a manual inspection of the generated Typed Clojure annotations,
we will perform several other experiments to measure the quality of the
generated annotations.

For example, we measure the number of changes needed
needed to amend generated annotations to actually type check.
\figref{infer:amending} shows some preliminary results.

\end{tabular}

  \label{infer:amending}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{clojure.spec Automatic Annotations}

We will present a formal model of clojure.spec and repurpose our automatic annotation
tool to generate clojure.spec runtime specifications.

We will then conduct a larger scale investigation to evaluate the quality 
of these annotations by generating clojure.spec annotations for several hundred
projects we have sourced from the open source community.
This investigation will also serve to further analyze the assumptions made 
in designing Typed Clojure and clojure.spec.
For example, Typed Clojure and clojure.spec are designed differently
around qualified entries in maps, and by generating and enforcing specs
we can investigate whether either are compatible with actual usage.

We can empirically investigate which function spec checking semantics are 
applicable in the majority of code. Since clojure.spec provides
two distinct function checking semantics, including a surprising
``generative testing'' semantics, we can measure the likelihood
of tests still passing after generating each kind of function spec.

Other interesting questions can be asked by using clojure.spec's generative
testing features. After generating our own specs automatically for each project,
we can test to see if our annotation algorithm feeds sufficient information
to clojure.spec's value generators to create effective generative tests.
We can also use the generative tests as a ``second pass'' over the functions,
by re-instrumenting our functions and analyzing whether we get better
test coverage than just running the provided unit tests.

clojure.spec supports stubbing-out functions, useful for running unit
tests that depend on side effecting functions. For example, we might
stub-out functions that call a database that only exists in production.
Using our generated specs, we could experimentally stub-out functions
that consistently fail their specs under generative testing,
and measure how useful the chosen stubs are by manually inspecting
which functions were stubbed.
Similarly, we could experiment in stubbing out function arguments
to higher-order functions to make instrumentation with \texttt{fspec}s
more predictable.

\subsection{How Clojure is used}

There is potential for other, more general, research questions
to be answered about Clojure usage with our testing setup.
Part of the unfinished work towards this thesis will be devising research questions,
but, for now, we can imagine a spectrum of questions
from simple measurements of the frequency of particular features like variable-arguments,
keyword maps, or higher-order functions, to more ambitious questions
like detecting breaking changes between project versions
and quantifying the test coverage of unit tests versus generative tests.

\section{Related Work}

% Cite a few of the early papers here.
%http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/pubs/
\paragraph{Typed Multimethods} 
Millstein and collaborators present a sequence of
systems~\cite{Chambers:1992:OMC,Chambers:1994:TMM,MS02} with statically-typed multimethods
and modular type checking.  In contrast to Typed Clojure, in these
system methods declare the types of arguments that they expect which
corresponds to exclusively using \clj{class} as the dispatch function
in Typed Clojure. However, Typed Clojure does not attempt to rule out
failed dispatches.

% one sentence
% TC based on TR, already covered

\paragraph{Occurrence Typing} 
Occurrence typing~\cite{TF08,TF10} extends the type 
system with a \emph{proposition environment} that represents 
the information on the types of bindings down conditional branches.
These propositions are then used to update the types associated
with bindings in the \emph{type environment} down branches
so binding occurrences are given different types 
depending on the branches they appear in, and the conditionals
that lead to that branch.

% What's diff about TC from the related work
% small summary for deisel....
% - diesel supports x
%- - calculus supports some subset of x
% we support y, which covers most of x but also foo

% eg. multiple dispatch
%     nominal vs structural

% eg. run abritrary metaprogramming over dispatch in CLOS
%  more expressive

% type systems for mm or rows
% rows vs HMap
% - no poly in HMap
% - based on subtyping
% - rows based on polymorphism

\paragraph{Record Types} Row polymorphism~\cite{Wand89typeinference,CM91,HP91}, used
in systems such as the OCaml object system, provides many of the
features of HMap types, but defined using universally-quantified row
variables. HMaps in Typed Clojure are instead designed to be used with
subtyping, but nonetheless provide similar expressiveness, including
the ability to require presence and absence of certain keys. 

Dependent JavaScript~\cite{Chugh:2012:DTJ} can track similar
invariants as HMaps with types for JS objects. They must deal with
mutable objects, they feature refinement types and strong updates to
the heap to track changes to objects.

TeJaS~\cite{TeJaS}, another type system for JavaScript,
also supports similar HMaps, with the ability to
record the presence and absence of entries, but lacks a compositional
flow-checking approach like occurrence typing.

Typed Lua~\cite{Maidl:2014:TLO} has \emph{table types} which track
entries in a mutable Lua table.  Typed Lua changes the dynamic
semantics of Lua to accommodate mutability: Typed Lua raises a runtime
error for lookups on missing keys---HMaps consider lookups on missing
keys normal.

\paragraph{Java Interoperability in Statically Typed Languages}
Scala~\cite{OCD+} has nullable references for compatibility with Java.
Programmers must manually check for
\java{null} as in Java to avoid null-pointer exceptions. 


\paragraph{Other optional and gradual type systems}
%In addition to Typed Racket, 
Several other gradual type
systems have been developed for existing
dynamically-typed languages.  Reticulated Python~\cite{Vitousek14} is
an experimental gradually typed system for Python, implemented as a
source-to-source translation that inserts dynamic checks at language
boundaries and supporting Python's first-class object system. 
Clojure's nominal classes avoids the need to support
first-class object system in Typed Clojure, however HMaps offer an alternative to
the structural objects offered by Reticulated. Similarly,
Gradualtalk~\cite{gradualtalk} offers gradual typing for Smalltalk,
with nominal classes.

Optional types
%, requiring less implementation effort and avoiding
%runtime cost, 
have been  adopted in industry, including Hack~\cite{hack}, and Flow~\cite{flow} and
TypeScript~\cite{typescript}, two extensions of JavaScript. These
systems  support  limited forms of occurrence typing,
and do not include the other features we
present.

\paragraph{Automatic annotations}
There are two common implementation strategies for such tools. The first
strategy, ``ruling-out'' (for invariant detection), assumes all invariants are true 
and then use runtime analysis results to rule out
impossible invariants. The second ``building-up'' strategy (for dynamic type inference)
assumes nothing and then uses runtime analysis results to build up invariant/type knowledge.

Examples of invariant detection tools include Daikon \cite{Ernst06thedaikon},
DIDUCE \cite{hangal2002tracking}, and Carrot \cite{pytlik2003automated}, and
typically enhance statically typed languages with more expressive types or contracts.
Examples of dynamic type inference include Rubydust \cite{An10dynamicinference},
JSTrace \cite{saftoiu2010jstrace}, and TypeDevil \cite{pradel2015typedevil},
and typically target untyped languages.

Both strategies have different space behavior with respect to representing
the set of known invariants.
The ruling-out strategy typically uses a lot of memory at the beginning,
but then can free memory as it rules out invariants. For example, if
\texttt{odd(x)} and \texttt{even(x)} are assumed, observing \texttt{x = 1}
means we can delete and free the memory recording \texttt{even(x)}.
Alternatively, the building-up strategy uses the least memory storing
known invariants/types at the beginning, but increases memory usage
as more the more samples are collected. For example, if we know
\texttt{x : Bottom}, and we observe \texttt{x = "a"} and \texttt{x = 1}
at different points in the program, we must use more memory to
store the union \texttt{x : String $\cup$ Integer} in our set of known invariants.

\paragraph{Daikon}
Daikon can reason about very expressive relationships between variables
using properties like ordering ($x < y$), linear relationships ($y = ax + b$),
and containment ($x \in y$). It also supports reasoning with ``derived variables''
like fields ($x.f$), and array accesses ($a[i]$).

Typed Clojure's dynamic inference can record heterogeneous data structures
like vectors and hash-maps, but otherwise cannot express relationships
between variables.

There are several reasons for this. The most prominent is that Daikon
primarily targets Java-like languages, so inferring simple type information
would be redundant with the explicit typing disciplines of these languages.
On the other hand, the process of moving from Clojure to Typed Clojure
mostly involves writing simple type signatures without dependencies
between variables. Typed Clojure recovers relevant dependent information
via occurrence typing, and gives the option to manually annotate necessary
dependencies in function signatures when needed.

\paragraph{How dynamic languages are used}
Several languages have seen similar investigations
into their idioms as I am proposing for Clojure.

A popular motivation is to discover which type system features to support
when retrofitting a type system.
% FIXME the is \AAkerblom but there's an error.. also in the bibliography
Akerblom et. al~\cite{Akerblom:2014:TDF:2597073.2597103} trace dynamic features in Python programs
via instrumentation. They measured the prevalence of dynamic features in startup versus
user code, and recorded usage frequencies for a set of dynamic features.
They concluded dynamism is prevalent in Python, and thus should be supported
in a retrofitted type system for Python.
A study along similar lines is also applicable to Clojure, in particular analysing Typed
Clojure's support for Clojure's dynamic features.

Calla{\'u} et al. \cite{Callau2013} also conducted a large-scale study of
dynamic Smalltalk idioms to inform future language extensions tooling support.
Notably, they further perform a qualitative analysis aiming to identify
the reasons why Smalltalk use these features in the first place, and
whether they can be replaced with more predictable features. They also 
measure which kinds of projects (e.g., testing frameworks, user-level libraries, or core system libraries) 
use particular features more frequently.
Due to the their prevalence in the open-source Clojure ecosystem,
Typed Clojure has mainly been tested on user-level libraries.
We could predict Typed Clojure's applicability to other kinds of projects
by gathering similar data on how frequently different types of Clojure libraries use
Clojure's various features.

Andreasen et. al~\cite{Andreasen2016TraceTA} developed
\emph{trace typing} to explore the design space of JavaScript type systems. 
Using runtime observations, they studied which control flow techniques
are used most often in JavaScript programs, and thus, which should
be supported by an effective type system for JavaScript.
Typed Clojure implements occurrence typing to reason about control
flow in Clojure which seems to work well in practice, but a similar
quantitative analysis could reveal further insights.

\paragraph{Interleaving Type Checking with Expansion, Extensible type systems and Symbolic Analysis}

Turnstile~\cite{Chang2017TSM} repurposes the Racket macro system
to simultaneously type check a program during its expansion to
a target language.

SugarJ~\cite{Erdweg2011SJ}
adds syntactic language extensibility to Java, such as pair
syntax, embedded XML, and closures.

% this paper has a great related works section that differentiates
% the strategies of several typed metaprogramming techniques
SoundX~\cite{Lorenzen2016STS} presents a solution to a common
dilemma in typed metaprogramming: whether to desugar before
type checking, or vice-versa.
%For example, Scala macros~\cite{Burmako2013SML} interleave type checking and
%desugaring
