\begin{abstract}
The Clojure programming language has existing tooling runtime and compile-time
verification.

This thesis argues Typed Clojure is sound and practical,
that we can improve usability with automatic annotations based on runtime observations,
and by repurposing this annotation technology to generate clojure.spec,
we can answer broad questions about how Clojure is used.

I will first present Typed Clojure, an optional type system for Clojure.
I will show a formal model of Typed Clojure that includes
key features like hash-maps, multimethods, Java interoperability, and occurrence typing,
and prove the model type sound.
Then, I will demonstrate that Typed Clojure's design is useful and corresponds to actual usage patterns
with an emperical study of real-world Typed Clojure usage in over 19,000 lines of code.

Next, I will present a tool that automatically generates Typed Clojure annotations based on observed
program behavior.
First, I will show a formal model of the tool, including its runtime instrumentation phase that
collects samples from a running program, and type reconstruction phase
that creates useful annotations from these samples.
