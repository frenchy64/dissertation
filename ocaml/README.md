# Exponential behavior of ML's type system

Translations of Milton's (1989) exponential growth of ML
principal type schemes.

(O'Caml versions from https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/6617/concise-example-of-exponential-cost-of-ml-type-inference)

The programs use a lambda encoding of pairs to build a massive nested
pairs, represented by function types.

## Instructions

How to run OCaml examples:

```
> ocaml
# #use "x3.ml";;
