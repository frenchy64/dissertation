The field of dynamic analysis has a rich history.
Ball~\cite{ball1999concept}
introduces frequency spectrum analysis,
an approach that observes a running program
that is similar to our instrumentation approach.
Mock~\cite{mock2003dynamic}
makes the case for efficient profiling of programs
to better facilitate usage of instrumentation.

Value Profiling is another related area which characterises
programs based on their running entities.

Daikon~\cite{ernst2001dynamically}
uses dynamic analysis to recover likely program invariants
in C programs.

Dynamic type inference has been attempted in many different
areas.
Rubydust~\cite{An10dynamicinference}
infers static types for Ruby. They prove the generated types
sound, which we do not. 
\begin{verbatim}
Conversely, they do not generate
recursive types, but recursive types in ruby are probably
nominal, so how different are we?
\end{verbatim}

In the context of JavaScript, several usages of this technique
can be found.
JSTrace~\cite{saftoiu2010jstrace}
generates types for (?).
Separately, work has been done to generate JSDoc-like annotations~\cite{odgaard2014}.
TypeDevil~\cite{pradel2015typedevil}
uses dynamic analysis to warn JavaScript programmers of possible inconsistencies
in their programs.

Work in recovering context-free grammars is most related to our algorithm
to recover recursive types.
% TODO Shamir~\cite{shamir1962remark} notes that it is impossible
% TODO \cite{knobe1976method}

In the context of machine learning, 
this area is called grammar induction or language learning.  % according to vcrepinvsek2005inferring
% TODO Wang\cite{wang1998grammar} summarises 
{\v{C}}repin{\v{s}}ek et. al~\cite{vcrepinvsek2005inferring}
use genetic programming to infer context-free grammars
for domain-specific languages.
Most work in this area assume both positive and negative
examples. We cannot distinguish between these two in
our system, so we assume all examples are positive.

Chen~\cite{chen1995bayesian} uses Bayesian inference to converge
on a suitable grammar, given examples.

There has been recent interest in approximate type inference.

Pluquet et. al~\cite{marot2009fast} investigate heuristics
to quickly infer types in dynamic programs.
So does Milojkovi{\'c}
\cite{milojkovic2016exploring}.
Spasojevi{\'c} et. al~\cite{spasojevic2014mining}
compare types across a cross section of projects to improve
inference.

Adamsen et. al~\cite{adamsen2016analyzing} verify test suite completeness using a hybrid approach of lightweight dependency analysis, static type checking and dynamic instrumentation.
