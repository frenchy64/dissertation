- Major Negatives
  - Insufficient, underwhelming evaluation (B.{6,21},C.6)
    - especially wrt contracts (A.5,B.40)
  - Lacking comparison to related works (B.7)

* Missing explanation and evaluation for generating good names (A.4,B.{5,9},D)
  (A.4) Inferring useful type names is one of the central contributions of the paper, and it's in fact a crucial (and often underrated) component of useful type annotations; yet it's not given enough attention in the paper and hasn't been evaluated quantitatively. Ideally, a user study is required to evaluate something like that.
  (C) No discussion of how they are able to come up with good names.
  (D) Some design goals/claims (good names, accuracy of type annotations w.r.t. a ground truth) aren't propertly evaluated 

* Cut off evaluation in Fig 13 (A.6)
* Immature tool (A.7)
* Insufficient methodology to evaluate claims of usefulness-over-soundness (A.8)

(B.15,C.18) inferRec not defined
(A.6,C.9) The end of section 3.2.1 ends abruptly -- "Via ... we start to trace update" and then what?

Review A
===============
(A.1) Ad-hoc technique forgoing soundness over compactness and generality is insufficiently motivated & evaluated 
(A.2) Why runtime analysis? Runtime vs static analysis? 
(A.3) Why choose to evaluate with Typed Clojure, given its limitations?
(A.5) Confusing evaluation of clojure.spec

Review B

(B.10) Misleading title, unconvinced this "collapses" much work
(B.{11,23}) Downsides of unsound types? Does Typed Clojure help correct them? Can they run as ordinary programs?

Confusions:
(B.12) What does the word 'generalized' mean on L199?
(B.35) `emit-dot`?
(B.36) L456 presumably `::` is `cons`?

Technical presentation:
(B.13) Weird `get` syntax
(B.14) Booleans/nil/top/empty-union unexplained
(B.17) `postwalk` unidiomatic in mathematics
(B.18) Rathers $\times$ than $,$ in function types
(B.19) The $\tau(\vec{\sigma})$ syntax is used (L670) well before it's defined (L749).

Related works:
(B.16) Your $\sqcup$ operation is similar to the meet used in Siek and Wadler's "Threesomes, with and without Blame" (STOP 2009/POPL 2010).

Implementation:
(B.20) How do you mix lazy+eager tracking?

Evaluation:
(B.21) Typed Clojure's limitations significantly weakens evaluation
(B.22) Please include time and memory information.
(B.24) Ideal evaluation would present type annotations to unsuspecting Clojure users.
(B.25) Suggestion: evaluate time to migrate (eg.) STLC typechecker & interpreter with+without your tool
